The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a full-stack React, FastAPI, and MongoDB application. The development followed a frontend-first with mock data approach, iterating on design refinements before backend integration. The initial request was to build a voting app blending two design images. The engineer first delivered a functional frontend with mock data, incorporating core voting, social features, and responsive design. User feedback led to significant enhancements, including media (image/video) uploads for poll options, with several iterations on how the percentage bar overlay should appear (initially inside, then full-width, finally vertical fill). Most recently, the application was expanded to include a comprehensive social structure with bottom navigation and dedicated pages for Feed, Explore, Profile, and Notifications. The current task is to address reported errors.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a voting application (APK) combining the functionality implied by a first image with the design aesthetics of a second image. The core features desired were the ability to vote and create polls.

Detailed breakdown of requirements and implementation so far:
1.  **Initial Core App**: A voting application where users can create new polls and vote on existing ones. It should feature real-time percentage updates, social functionalities like likes, comments (implied by counters), and shares. The design should incorporate a grid layout for polls, smooth animations, modern gradients (blue-purple), micro-interactions (hover, scale), and a glass morphism header. It must be responsive.
2.  **Media Uploads**: Poll options must support uploading photos (jpg, png, gif, webp) and videos (mp4, webm, mov, avi) via drag & drop, with real-time preview. These media files should be converted to Base64 for display. The display of options should be a 2x2 grid, with video thumbnails and play buttons. Progress bars for uploads were requested and implemented.
3.  **Percentage Bar Design Iterations**:
    *   Initially, the percentage bar was to appear *within* the image/video, with a semi-transparent overlay.
    *   Then, it was refined to *adapt to the entire image* proportionally (filling from left to right).
    *   Finally, the bar was modified to *fill vertically* from bottom to top, similar to Instagram Stories, with the same dynamic color scheme (blue for selected, green for winner, gray for normal).
4.  **Social Navigation & User Profiles**: The application expanded from just voting to a social platform. This requires:
    *   A bottom navigation bar with sections for Feed (displaying polls from followed users), Explore (discover new polls, search, categories, trending topics), Create (central button for new polls), Activity (notifications), and Profile (user's personal page).
    *   A dedicated Profile page showing user statistics (followers, polls created, total votes), and tabs for My Polls, Likes, and Activity.
    *   A Notifications page with different types of notifications (likes, comments, followers, votes).
    *   A Feed page showing polls from followed users.
    *   An Explore page for searching and discovering polls by categories and trending topics.

All frontend development has been done using mock data to achieve the aha moment first, with an explicit prompt to proceed to backend integration after design approval. The most recent request is to fix the errors related to the newly implemented navigation and profile screens.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Frontend-First Development**: Initial focus on UI/UX with mock data for rapid prototyping.
-   **Responsive Design**: Adapting UI for mobile and desktop using Tailwind CSS.
-   **UI Component Library**: Utilization of  components.
-   **Media Handling**: Base64 encoding for image/video display on the frontend.
-   **State Management**: Local React state for mock data,  hook for notifications.
-   **Routing**: React Router DOM for multi-page navigation.
-   **Environment Variables**: Strict usage of  and .

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. The core principle is a modular design, especially in the frontend, using reusable UI components and separating concerns like mock data and utility functions.

**Directory Structure:**



**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the React application, responsible for setting up the router and defining the application's pages.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained a simple  component. It was significantly modified to integrate  for navigation, include the  component, and define routes for , , , and . The original  component now serves as the  content.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Stores and manages all the mock data used for the frontend-only implementation, simulating backend responses for polls, votes, and social interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Updated multiple times to include example polls with images/videos, social counters, and to reflect the latest poll structure (e.g., with media options, base64 data).
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Renders a single poll item on the feed/explore pages, including the poll question, options, voting mechanism, social counters, and media display.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent multiple iterations:
        1.  Initial version for basic voting and social features.
        2.  Updated to display uploaded images/videos as poll options, including thumbnails for videos and a 2x2 grid layout.
        3.  Modified to display the percentage bar superposed on media, initially as a small bar at the bottom.
        4.  Further modified to make the percentage bar cover the entire media proportionally from left to right.
        5.  Final modification to make the percentage bar fill *vertically* from bottom to top, applying an overlay effect.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Provides the user interface for creating new polls, including input fields for questions and options, and handling media uploads.
    -   **Changes**: Expanded significantly to support individual image/video uploads for each poll option, including drag & drop, real-time previews, validation, and error handling for media files.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: New component responsible for rendering the persistent bottom navigation bar across the application.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created to include navigation links to Feed, Explore, Create (modal trigger), Activity, and Profile pages.
-   , , , :
    -   **Importance**: Newly created pages that define the specific content and layout for each main section of the social voting application.
    -   **Changes**: New file creations, each containing mock-up UIs for their respective functionalities (e.g., search, categories, user stats, activity lists).
-   :
    -   **Importance**: The FastAPI backend entry point. Currently provides basic API endpoints for a status check but will be expanded for full CRUD operations related to polls, users, votes, and media.
    -   **Changes**: No significant changes were explicitly made or reported in this trajectory, other than initial setup.

The frontend extensively uses Shadcn UI components (imported from ) and Tailwind CSS for styling, adhering to the provided design guidelines regarding motion, depth, typography, and color.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Backend Development**: Implementing MongoDB models, CRUD endpoints, and integrating with the frontend to replace mock data with real database interactions. This has been consistently asked as a next step but not initiated yet.
-   **Error Resolution**: The user explicitly requested to fix the errors after the implementation of the navigation and profile pages. This implies existing bugs or issues that need to be addressed.
</pending_tasks>
<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed implementing the full navigation structure and associated pages (Feed, Explore, Profile, Notifications) for the social voting application. This involved creating several new React components and pages, and updating the main  file to handle routing. The application currently functions entirely on mock data, demonstrating the UI and user flow for these new social features, along with the previously developed poll creation, voting, and media display functionalities with their specific percentage bar designs (vertical fill).

The user's last message, Soluciona los errores (Fix the errors), indicates that there are currently unaddressed issues or bugs within the application, likely related to the recently added navigation and page components. The previous engineer's work paused at the point of receiving this error-fixing request.
