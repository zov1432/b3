The previous AI engineer effectively took a TikTok-style poll application from a basic MVP to a significantly enhanced state. The process involved a structured diagnostic approach, incremental feature development, and diligent bug fixing based on user feedback. Key accomplishments include fully integrating real backend APIs, implementing a robust image/video upload system with drag-and-drop, and transforming the desktop UI into a professional, modern layout. The engineer demonstrated a strong ability to understand complex errors, trace them through the stack, and apply targeted fixes. The final identified problem relates to the image URLs not correctly pointing to the local server, indicating a configuration or path issue within the upload mechanism, which is the immediate next task.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested identifying what was missing from an existing TikTok-style poll application. The AI engineer identified several missing core functionalities, gamification, UI/UX improvements, and advanced features. The user then explicitly requested to Conectar APIs reales (connect real APIs). Following this, the user asked to repara el error que aparece en el feed de inicio (fix the error in the home feed). After successful resolution, the user requested to implement a Sistema de upload de imágenes y vídeos (image and video upload system) with specific features like drag & drop and previews, covering avatars, poll options, and backgrounds, supporting JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, MP4, WebM, MOV. The user then asked Haz un sitio web para computadoras mejor que el de ahora (make a better website for computers), focusing on a modern desktop layout. Subsequently, the user reported issues: Las publicaciones no muestran el contenido y los perfiles no están conectados por ejemplo la publicación que subí no aparece en mi perfil (posts don't show content, profiles aren't connected, my post isn't on my profile). After fixing these, the user stated, Realize una publicación pero no muestra la imagen y en el perfil no aparece la publicación que hice (I made a post, but the image isn't showing, and the post isn't on my profile), further clarifying that images were uploaded from a mobile device, not a URL.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user report regarding image uploads: Las imágenes las subi desde un dispositivo móvil no es una url (I uploaded the images from a mobile device, it's not a URL), indicating that images uploaded via the new system were not displaying correctly in the feed or profiles. The AI engineer diagnosed that the problem was not with the upload mechanism itself (as evidenced by successful uploads), but with the URLs generated or used by the application, which were incorrectly pointing to external domains like  instead of the local server where the files are stored. The current focus is on fixing this specific issue to ensure uploaded images are correctly referenced and displayed. This issue arises despite a fully implemented upload system and a significantly improved desktop UI.
